# Problem Statement
Develop a simple web server which is capable of processing only one request. Develop a simple client which sends a request for an image file (i.e., pgm format) and the server sends the file to the client. The client after receiving the file, inverts it and sends it to the server. The server after receiving it, displays theinverted image and the original image side by side.
